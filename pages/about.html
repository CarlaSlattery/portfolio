    <h1>My Bio</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Back to homepage</a>

  <p>Based in North Staffordshire, UK, I am currently undertaking a six month intensive remote course with <a href="#">Manchester Codes</a> 
    to elevate my skills as a full stack software developer. </p>
<br />
<p>I am a qualified physiotherapist and have had a fantastic career spanning 10 years with the NHS, which I am very proud of. This has given me great experience
  working and collaborating with others, as well as learning to adapt quickly and to recognise when to use your initiative and when to seek support from others 
  to achieve the best outcome possible.
</p>
<br />
<p>Believe it or not, I think there are a lot of similarities with software development - not least being able to problem solve, always consider the end user and 
  make sure you have solid documentation. There is also a technical knowlegde involved for both and I love to learn!
